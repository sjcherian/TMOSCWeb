        		O Lord Eternal and Creator of all things, Who of Thy inscrutable goodness called me to this life; Who bestowed on me the grace of Baptism and the Seal of the Holy Spirit; Who imbued me with the desire to seek Thee, the one true God: hear my prayer.<br> 
                I have no life, no light, no joy or wisdom; no strength except in Thee, O God.<br> 
                Because of my unrighteousness I dare not raise my eyes to Thee.<br> 
                But Thou said to Thy disciples, 'Whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing, you shall receive.'<br> 
                and 'Whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do.'<br> 
                Wherefore I dare to invoke Thee.<br> 
                Purify me from all taint of flesh and spirit.<br> 
                Teach me to pray aright.<br> 
                Bless this day which Thee give unto me, Thy unworthy servant.<br> 
                By the power of Thy blessing enable me at all times to speak and act to Thy glory with a pure spirit, with humility, patience, love, gentleness, peace, courage and wisdom: aware always of Thy presence.<br> 
                Of Thy immense goodness, O Lord God, show me the path of Thy will, and grant me to walk in Thy sight without sin.<br> 
                O Lord, unto Whom all hearts be open, Thee know what things I have need of.<br> 
                Thee are acquainted with my blindness and my ignorance, Thee know my infirmity and my soul's corruption; but neither are my pain and anguish hid from Thee.<br> 
                Wherefore I beseech Thee, hear my prayer and by Thy Holy Spirit teach me the way wherein I should walk; and when my perverted will would lead me down other paths spare me not O Lord, but force me back to Thee.<br> 
                By the power of Thy love, grant me to hold fast to that which is good.<br> 
                Preserve me from every word or deed that corrupts the soul; from every impulse unpleasing in Thy sight and hurtful to my brother-man.<br> 
                Teach me what I should say and how I should speak.<br> 
                If it be Thy will that I make no answer, inspire me to keep silent in a spirit of peace that causes neither sorrow nor hurt to my fellow man.<br> 
                Establish me in the path of Thy commandments and to my last breath let me not stray from the light of Thy ordinances, that Thy commandments may become the sole law of my being on this earth and all eternity.<br> 
                Yea, Lord, I pray to Thee, have pity on me.<br> 
                Spare me in my affliction and my misery and hide not the way of salvation from me.<br> 
                In my foolishness, O God, I plead with Thee for many and great things.<br> 
                Yet am I ever mindful of my wickedness, my baseness, my vileness.<br> 
                Have mercy upon me.<br> 
                Cast me not away from your presence because of my presumption.<br> 
                Do Thee rather increase in me this presumption, and grant unto me, the worst of men, to love Thee as Thee have commanded, with all my heart, and with all my soul, and with all my mind, and with all my strength:<br> 
                with my whole being.<br> 
                Yea, O Lord, by Thy Holy Spirit, teach me good judgment and knowledge.<br> 
                Grant me to know Thy truth before I go down into the grave.<br> 
                Maintain my life in this world until I may offer unto Thee worthy repentance.<br> 
                Take me not away in the midst of my days, nor while my mind is still blind.<br> 
                When Thee shall be pleased to bring my life to an end, forewarn me that I may prepare my soul to come before Thee.<br> 
                Be with me, O Lord, at that dread hour and grant me the joy of salvation.<br> 
                Cleanse me from secret faults, from all iniquity that is hidden in me; and give me a right answer before Thy judgment-seat.<br> 
                Yea, Lord, of Thy great mercy and immeasurable love for mankind.<br>Amen

For Thou art my Creator, Provider and Bestower of every good; wherefore all my hope is in Thee, and to Thee I ascribe glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.<br>

We thank Thee that Thou hast not destroyed us in our transgressions, but in Thy love toward mankind, Thou hast raised us up that we might glorigy Thy Majesty. We entreat Thine infinite goodness, enlighten the eyes of our understanding and raise up our minds from the heavy sleep of indolence; open our mouths and fill them with Thy praise, that we may unceasingly sing and confess Thee, Who art God glorified in all and by all, the eternal Father, the Only- Begotten Son, and the All-Holy and Good and Life-Giving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.<br> 
            <br>Grant unto me, my Lord, that with peace in mind I may face all that this new day is to bring. Grant unto me grace to surrender myself completely to Thy holy will. Instruct and prepare me in all things for every hour of this day. Whatsoever tidings I may receive during the day, do Thou teach me to accept them calmly, in the firm conviction that all eventualities fulfill Thy holy will. Govern Thou my thoughts and feelings in all I do and say. When things unforeseen occur, let me not forget that all cometh down from Thee. Teach me to behave sincerely and reasonable toward every member of my family and all other human beings, that I may not cause confusion and sorrow to anyone. Bestow upon me, my Lord, strength to endure the fatigue of the day and to bear my share in all its passing events. Guide Thou my will and teach me to pray, to believe, to hope, to suffer, to forgive, and to love.<br>

        O Lord my Savior and my Master, I, Thine unprofitable servant, with fear and trembling give thanks unto Thy loving goodness for all Thy benefits which Thou hast poured so abundantly upon me, Thy servant. I fall down in adoration before Thee and offer Thee, O god, my praises; with fervor I cry to Thee: O God, deliver me henceforth from all adversities and mercifully fulfill in me such of my desires as may be expedient for me. Hear me, I entreat Thee, and have mercy, for Thou art the Hope of all the ends of the earth, and unto Thee, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be ascribed glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.<br>
        I praise Thee, O God of our Fathers, I hymn Thee, I bless Thee, I give thanks unto thee for Thy great and tender mercy. To Thee I flee, O merciful and mighty God. Shine into my heart with the True Sun of Thy righteousness. Enlighten my mind and keep all my senses, that henceforth I may walk uprightly and keep Thy commandments, and may finally attain unto eternal life, even to Thee, Who art the source of life, and be admitted to the glorious fruition of Thy inaccessible Light. For Thou art my God, and unto Thee, O Father, Son and Holy Spirit, be ascribed glory, now and ever and unto ages of ages.<br>
