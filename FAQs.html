		            <b>ABOUT THE HOLY TRINITY</b><br>
                    (1)There is only one God, who is life and truth, the creator of everything visible and<br>
                    invisible. (2) There is no other God than the One God, who is the original cause of <br>
                    everything. (3) He is without beginning and is eternal. (4) He is incorporeal and cannot be<br>
                    seen by eyes of the flesh, and is omnipotent. (5) Omniscient. (6) Omnipresent. <br><br>
                    (7) perfect in goodness. (8) Inconceivable. (9) is without change. (10) and is ruler of<br>
                    everything. (11) Them are three personalities in Godhead—the Father, Son and the Holy <br>
                    Spirit. (12) That is, one in three and three in one. Between the three persons there is no<br>
                    variation as regards seniority, stature or strength. They have one essence, one kingship, one<br>
                    nature, one will, one thinking, one power, one glory and one leadership. <br><br><br>

                    <i>(1) John 10:29. What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father's hand. <br>
                    (2) I Cor. 8:6 The Father from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ,
                    through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</i>

            <BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT THE SON</b><br>
                    (1)The Word and Son of the Father, one among the Trinity, was born eternally from the Father. (2) is one in Essence with The Father and the Holy Spirit, and is uncreated. (3)The Son, without any change in His Godly estate, by His Father and the Holy spirit, took flesh from the holy virgin, became man, for the salvation of men (4) truly suffered in the flesh, (5) was crucified, (6) and died, (7) was buried (8) descended into hell and preached the good news to those who were there (9)rose from the dead on the third day. (10) On the 40th day after Resurrection, He ascended into Heaven, and sat on the right side of His Father.<br><br>
                    That He became Man, does not mean that He dwelt in a righteous man born of a virgin, (11) on the other hand, that, He who is truly God, took flesh from the virgin without contact with man, by the Holy Spirit, and became truly man. (12) Without Godly nature changing to become human nature, without human nature changing to become Godly nature, or both getting mixed up, or uniting to become another substance, or one getting annihilated by the other, the two natures, Godhead and Man-hood, with perfect characteristics of both, except sin, were united never again to be separated. This union is a great mystery. (13) After the union, there can be no separation into two natures or two personalities.<br><br>
                    But, one nature, one person, one pursupa (face)*, one will and one operation. He is perfect God and perfect man. When the spirit got separated from the body at the time of His death, (14) His Godhead without getting separated from the spirit and body, dwelt with both of them! (15) Because His Body was made incorruptible at Resurrection, never again have death or suffering authority over Him. (16) He is the way, the Truth and the Life. Without Him nobody is saved. (17) He will come again in His glory to judge the living and the dead. <br><br><br>

					<b>ABOUT THE HOLY SACRAMENTS</b><br>
                    Sacraments are the visible operations of invisible graces, ordained and instituted by our Lord, which are necessary for the salvation of mankind. These are also called Divine Mysteries.<br>
                    Among the seven Sacraments <br>
                    (1) Baptism, (2) Holy Qurbana, (3) Confession, (4) Chrismation, (5) Priesthood (Ordination), (6) Matrimony and (7) Anointing the sick,<br>
                    (8) five are intended for all the faithful, and other two, priesthood and matrimony, are only for those who want to have them. <br>
                    The Sacraments are to be received with the appropriate preparation and eligibility for each of them. Those who received them thus, will get the grace of God, and also increase the grace in them.<br><br><br>

                    <i>(1) John 3:5 No one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. <br>
                    (2) John 6:53 So Jesus said to them, Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.<br>
                    (3) James 5:16 Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. <br>
                    (4) 1 John 2:27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and so you do not need anyone to teach you.<br>
                    (5) Heb. 5:4 And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.<br>
                    (6) Matthew 19:6 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. <br>
                    (7) James 5:14 Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.<br>
                    (8) Num. 8: 1,2 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to Aaron and say to him: When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand. Num.4.2</i>";
						
			<BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT HOLY BAPTISM</b><br>
                    Baptism is the first among the Sacraments. Other sacraments shall not be received before receiving Holy Baptism. (1) Through baptism, one gets sonship (of God) and becomes eligible for remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit. (3) And for the fellowship in the company of the children of God. (4) But sacraments like baptism shall be received with devotion and faith; (5) because, sonship and love of God are obtained through faith. (6) Things like Chrism, olive oil and water which are used in sacraments like baptism, actions like making the baptize and confess the faith, laying of hands, breathing on the candidate, making the sign of the cross on the forehead etc. signify the graces which are received from God, and also things we are obliged to believe in and act upon, and those things that Christ did, as well as the invisible operations of the Spirit of God.<br>
                    This is called Mamoodeeso(baptism) which means 'bathing' or 'washing', because those who receive baptism with true faith and devotion are washed clean of defilements, with water. (7) It is also called light, since, by this one is made to move from darkness of ignorance, and approach the divine light. (8) Baptism is also called ‘rebirth', since those who are born again from the womb of baptism, are children of grace. Since all humanity is condemned to punishment by God, not only due to sins of action, but also due to the original sin; and that forgiveness of sins and grace of God are obtained through baptism. <br>
                    (9) The grace of baptism shall not be denied to little children. There shall be an assigned mediator in baptism for the following purposes- to show their deep desire for the salvation of children, to stand as representatives of children and to do things like confession of faith on their behalf, in the baptism of little children, to be persons responsible to teach children true faith and the like. (10)There is only one baptism for the remission of Sins. therefore, if a person, after being baptised, forsakes his faith in Christ, but later believes and come back, it is not necessary to baptize him once again. <br>
                    He should be received back solely on the basis of his repentance. However, the baptism conducted by heretics who have discarded the true faith of the church, and those who do not have the lawful laying of hands in ordination ,is to be reckoned as lacking perfection. Instead, as prescribed in the Hoodaya Canon, the faith position of each heretic shall be examined, and accordingly, some are only to be anointed with the prayers of anointing with 0il; some others are only made to abjure their heresy; and some others are to be baptized using the entire order of service.<br><br><br>

                    <i>(I) Gal. 3:27 As many of you as were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 29. And if you belong to Christ then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise. John 3:5<br>
                    (2) Act. 22:16. And now why do you delay? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away, calling on his name. Act. 2:38 Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit.<br>
                    (3) 1 Cor.12:13 For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. <br>
                    (4) Act. 8:36, 38 and the eunuch said, Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptised? and then Philip baptized him. <br>
                    (5) Gal. 3:26. For in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. <br>
                    (6) Rom. 6. 3,4. Do you not know that all of us who have been baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. 1 Peter 3:21. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. John 20:22. When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, receive the Holy Spirit. John 13: 14, 15. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have set you an Example, that you also should do as l have done to you. Act. 8:17. Then Peter and John laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.<br>
                    (7) 1 Peter 2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, Gods own People, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of the darkness into his marvellous light. <br>
                    (8) John 3:3. No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above. Tit 3:5 but according to his mercy, through the water of re-birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit<br>
                    (9) Mark 10:13, 14, 16. People were bringing little Children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that  the kingdom of God belongs to And he took them up in his arms ,laid his hands on them, and blessed them. Gen 17 :10-14<br>
                    (10) Eph. 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism.</i>" ;

    <BR><BR><BR><b>UNDERSTANDING INFANT BAPTISM</b><br>
            Coming to infants, faith, repentance and dedication, are not required from them, as a pre-condition to baptism. They can receive baptism and experience re-birth, through the faith of their parents and the Church, which administer this sacrament. As the infant grow, they must be helped to grow in the experience of re-birth, through personal commitment.<br>
    The conditions to be satisfied in infant baptism are (1) At least one parent must be a Christian In the case of an orphan, the foster parent must be a Christian. (2) There must be a god-parent, to take upon himself or herself, the responsibility of bringing up the child in Christian faith and dedication. The god-parent denounces satan and proclaims faith in Jesus Christ, on behalf of the child.<br>
            The faith of the congregation is also important, whether infant baptism or adult baptism. Note that the disciples were not able to heal a boy, because of their lack of faith even though the boy’s father had faith (St. Mark 9:17-29).<br>
            Examples of children and grown-ups who were benefited by the faith of others:<br>
            * The Children, blessed by Jesus, were not in a position to have faith. Their mothers had faith.<br>
            * The daughter of the Canaanite woman was healed, through the faith of the mother (St. Mark 15:21-28)<br>
            * John the Baptist, while in the womb of the mother, received Holy Spirit (St. Luke 1:15, 39-44). It must had been through the faith of the mother.<br>
            * The man sick of palsy was given the forgiveness of sins, through the faith of those who brought him (St. Matthew 9:1-2)<br><br><BR>
            Other reasons which justify Infant Baptism:<br>
            1. To deny infants, baptism, means denial of the entry into the kingdom of God (St.John 3:3).  Jesus answered In truth, in very truth I tell you, unless a man has been born over again, he cannot see the kingdom of heaven. It is against the command of Jesus Christ who said Let the children come to me and prevent them not (St Mark 10:14)<br>
            2. To deny children, baptism is also against the words of St. Peter, on the day of the Pentecost. For the promise is to you and to your children (infants) and to all who are far away, every-one whom the Lord our God may call (Acts 2:39). Here the Greek word used for children is tekna meaning infants.<br>
            3. It is universally accepted fact that the spiritual foundation of children is laid, in the very early years of infancy, hence it follows that baptism is to given as early as possible.<br>
            4. In fact infant baptism proclaims the truth that is God who takes the initiative in our spiritual life. This agrees with the words of God given through the prophet Isaiah For the sake of Jacob my servant, and Israel my chosen, I called you by name, and given you, your title, though you have not known me, I am the Lord, there is no other; there is no god besides me. I will strengthen you, though you have not known me. (Isaiah 45:4-5).  The Holy Spirit takes the initiative when He enters our hearts and gives us faith. And no one can say, Jesus is Lord except under the influence of the Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 12:3). It is true that we have to respond to the working of the Holy Spirit. In the case of infants, they can respond as they grow up. See how the Spirit worked in John the Baptist, as he grew up from infancy. As the child grew up he became strong in Spirit (St Luke 1:80).<br>
            5. There is not a single verse in the Holy Bible, against infant baptism and there is no record of any postponement of baptism to adulthood, in the Holy Bible.<br>
            6. At the same time we find whole families getting baptised which implies infant baptism. The word family or household is used in the Holy Bible when there is at least one child for the couple. That is why in the case of Zachariah and Elizabeth, we read ‘Both of them and not Zachariah’s family (St.Luke 1:6). Hence baptism of a person’s household includes baptism of children also.<br>
            a. Lydia’s household was baptism as we see in Acts 16:15. She was baptized and her household with her.<br>
            b. The jailor of Philippi and his whole family were baptised as we see in Acts 16:33.<br>
            c. The baptism of the household of Stephanos is mentioned I Corinthians: 1:16.<br>
            d. The Baptism of the household of Crispus mentioned in Acts 18:6. Crispus, who held office in the synagogue, now became a believer in the Lord, with all this household and a number of Corinthians listened and believed, and were baptised.<br>
            These incidental references show that infant baptism was prevalent in the apostolic times. But a person who received baptism in his infancy, if he does not live a life of faith and repentance will not be benefited by his baptism. The baptismal covenant or dedication, is to be renewed again and again, through Holy Confession, whether he had received his baptism in infancy or adulthood. If anyone wishes to be a follower of mine, he must leave self behind, day by day; he must take up his cross and come with me (St Luke 9:23).<br>
            Baptism shall not be repeated in any case, if it was conducted according to the canons of the Church. Once a son is always a son is always a son. If he turns out to be a prodigal, what is necessary is only repentance and re-dedication, and not repetition of baptism. Repetition of baptism, is against the words of St. Paul, who says One Lord, One faith, One Baptism ‘(Eph. 4:5)<br>

<BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT THE HOLY QURBANA (EUCHARIST)</b><br>
                    Holy Qurbana is the Sacrament that makes us partake in The Holy Body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ as food and drink, for the well being and salvation of our souls.(1)Because the Word united with human nature, just as His humanity is called God', the Holy Spirit dwells in the bread and wine offered in the Holy Qurbana. (2) Therefore it is to be believed that they are the Holy Body and Blood of the Lord, according to His command that 'this is My Body, and this is My Blood', (3) Though the substance does not change in sight and taste, to become the Holy Body and Blood, (4) those who receive them with faith and devotion get remission of sins and eternal life as the fruit of the Holy Body and Blood of our Lord. (5) But those who partake of it, without discrimination and devotion shall be condemned (6) It is not only that the Holy Qurbana is participation in the Holy Body and the Blood of Jesus,<br>
                    (7) but also it is a sacrifice and offering according to the New Testament. (8) This sacrifice is more fruitful and glorious than sacrifices according to the Law and Old testament like blood offerings which foreshowed that the one sacrifice of Christ is to take place. (9) By this, it is shown that the sacrifice of Christ, for the sake of the salvation of the world has been accomplished: and it recalls his birth, public ministry, death, burial, resurrection etc.  The articles like bread, wine, Tablet (portable Altar) etc, used in the Holy Qurbana and actions like fraction (breaking of the bread) and elevation of mysteries, symbolise the articles and actions used by Christ in His one and only sacrifice. It is not authorised to give Body alone, or Blood alone to the people, without the 'fraction' service in which Body and Blood are mixed. <br>
                    (10) Since through the service of fraction, Blood is mixed in the Body and Body is mixed in the Blood, Qurbana can be dispensed either from the cup or from the chalice, and it is unnecessary to give twice, since Body and Blood are there in both. Those who receive the Holy Qurbana shall take Holy Confession sincerely, and receive it with true faith, devotion and prayer, and also preparing oneself with fasting, for the honour of the Holy Qurbana. (11) The bread that is used in the Holy Qurbana must be leavened, just as the bread used by Christ in his last supper was leavened. (12) Thus, through this, it is shown that Christ is the leaven that gives life to the whole world.<br><br><br>

                    <i>(1) Heb. 2:9 so that by the Grace of God he might taste death for everyone<br>
                    (2) Mark 14:22-23 while they were eating, he took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to them, and said, Take;  this is my body Then he took up a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, and all of them drank from it. He said to them, This is my blood Of the Covenant, which is poured out for many. John 6:55. for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Matthew 26:26-28. Luke 22:19, 20 & 1Cor. 11:24-29<br>
                    (3) 1 Cor. 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.<br>
                    (4) 1 Cor. 11:28 examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup. Matthew 26:28. for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. John 6:51,53, 54,56,57 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. So Jesus said to them, Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me.<br>
                    (5) 1 Cor. 11:29-30 For all who eat and drink without discerning the body eat and drink judgement against themselves. For this reason many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. <br>
                    (6) 1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?<br>
                    (7) Mal.1:11. For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts. Matthew 5:23,24 So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother and sister and then come and offer your gift. Eph. 5:2. Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.<br>
                    (8) Heb. 10:1 Since the law was only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities. Heb.9:13,14 For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified. how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God! <br>
                    (9) Luke. 22: 1 9. Do this in remembrance of me. 1 Cor. 11: 20.24-26.<br>
                    (10) Rom. 6:9. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. Isa. 6:6-7 Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out. John 6:51.<br>
                    (II) Mark. 14:22. while they were eating, he took a loaf of bread. I Cor. 5:8 therefore, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <br>
                    (12) Matthew 13:33. He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.* <br>
                    * The syriac word Ammeera here used for bread, is used for bread make with leavened dough, and not for making bread with unleavened bread (Patheera).</i> ";


<BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT HOLY CONFESSION</b><br>
                    Confession is a sacrament in which we receive remission of sins through repentance before God, by confessing our sins before the priest, who is the representative of God. It is also known as the sacrament (mystery) of repentance (1) It is right and be-coming on the part of priests, as representatives of God, to preach to the people, correct them, admonish them about their open sins, and lead them in the path of righteousness. Besides, as far as possible, the priest should try to know their activities, and also their inner spiritual condition, and give each of them the necessary counsel, and save them from their wrong ways.<br>
                    The priest shall admonish the people about their sins sympathetically like a loving father. They shall prescribe appropriate amends to be made by the people for their sins, like fasting, giving alms and the like; they should tell the people and make them fear the justice of God, comfort them by making them depend on God's grace by telling them about His mercy, (2) saying on them the prayer of absolution, and bless them. For priests to do these things, it is necessary to know about the activities and inner condition of each person. (3) Those who made their confession should reveal to the priest, all their sins, and the state of their conscience.<br>
                    (4) The priest should never reveal to any one, the sins revealed to him. Any priest, who violates this and reveals them, shall be liable for condemnation and punishment.(5) Priests do not acquire the authority to forgive sins by their own righteousness or their own power. (6) They pronounce forgiveness of sins by their advice, (7) by their prayers and by the grace they have received from the Lord. If it is right to say that the woman resurrected by the Lord by the prayer of Peter, was resurrected by Peter, then it is equally right to say about the  Lord forgiving sins through confession and other sacraments, that the priests have authority to forgive sins. This agrees with the command of the Lord, If you forgive someone his sins, he shall be forgiven, and shall not amount to blasphemy.<br><br><br>
                    (1) Mal. 2:7 For the lips of the priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. Isa 3:17-21 Mortal, I have made you a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. If I say to the wicked, You shall surely die and you give them no warning, or speak to warn the wicked from their wicked way, in order to save their life……………………………. etc.<br>
                     Titus 1:9 He must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching, so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it. I Tim. 5:20 As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest also may stand in fear. <br>
                    (2) Lev. 5:5-6 When you realize your guilt in any of these, you shall confess the sin that you have committed. And you shall bring to the Lord, as your penalty for the sin that you have committed…….etc. and the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for your sin.<br>
                    (3) Deu. 26:3-3-10. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him,……. etc. Psal. 111:1.1 will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart, in the company of the upright, in the congregation. Matthew 3:6 and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Matthew 8:4. Then Jesus said to him. See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them. Act. 19:18 Also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices. James 5:16 Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective. Num. 5:6,7 Lev.13. Pro.28:13<br>
                    (4) Pro. 11:13 A gossip goes about telling secrets, but one who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a confidence. Pro. 25:9. Argue your case with your neighbour directly, and do not disclose another's secret.<br>
                    (5) Acts 3:12, When Peter saw it, he addressed the people,  You  Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our power or piety we had made him walk?<br>
                    (6) James 5:19,20 – My brothers and sisters, if any one among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another, you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinner's soul from death and  will cover a multitude of sins.<br>
                    (7) 1 Tit. 2:1,2 – First of all, then I urge that supplication and thanksgiving be made for everyone, for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and dignity.<br>
                    (8) John 20:22,23 – When he has said this, he breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retains the sins of any, they are retained. 1Tim. 4:14 – DO not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with laying on of hands by the council of elders";



<BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT HOLY OILS</b><br>
                    It is necessary that (1) we put on Christ in baptism (2) be born again in water and Holy Spirit (3) and be anointed by him and sealed for life. (4) Therefore, as the sign of these things, it is necessary to be anointed and sealed by holy Chrism and consecrated olive oil. Holy Chrism, which is consecrated by the Chief Metropolitan alone is used in baptism and also in the consecration of churches and tablets (Portable Altars). The olive oil sanctified by the bishops is also used in baptism. The use of these holy oils teaches us that we are to put on Christ and are to be reborn by the Holy Spirit, and we be sealed for life; It also shows us by action that it is being done so. When it is used in this way, they should be used in faith and devotion that they become effective in the spirit too.<br><br><br>

			 <BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT THE HOLY ORDERS</b><br>
                    Priests are the guides to transform worldly people to be heavenly, and those with animal nature to be of Godly nature.<br>
                    (1)They are the ambassadors of the unseen (2) God and the ministers of the Holy sacraments entrusted to the church by God. (3)No one can take this position upon himself on his own. (4)It shall be only for those chosen according to the will of God, and who receives the laying of hands from Christ. (5)Without the laying of hands according to this, and the necessary permission, no one has the authority to minister in the church or to preach publicly. The higher authority for the holy orders shall vest with the Patriarch Moran Mar Ignatius, who reigns on the throne of Antioch. (6)Those who belong to the holy orders, as long as they are not ousted or excommunicated by council (synods ) or by their respective higher ( spiritual ) authorities, though they are ineligible, nobody can doubt about the fruits of the sacraments ministered by them or refrain from participating in them.<br>
                    Because they have (7) the holy anointment in them, and because the sacraments are ministered unto them in the name of Christ, and because the fruits of the sacraments do not depend on the righteousness of the priest who ministers unto them, those who participate in them with pure conscience and true faith, get their benefits. However for those priests who minister unto them in an unholy and unbecoming manner, they shall be for condemnation and punishment. (8)However, those who are seen as evil, shall be excommunicated, after which they shall not administer any sacraments; and the faithful laity shall not partake with those who defy and administer sacraments.<br><br><br>

                    (1) 2 Cor. 5:20  So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<br>

<BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT MARRIAGE</b><br>
                    Marriage is a holy sacrament that binds man and woman binds them inseparably and unites them spiritually, and gives them and their children blessings and graces from God.<br>
                    1- Marriage is good 2- Marriage should not be denied to anyone. 3- However, no one has the right to marry another woman, when his lawful wife is alive, or to divorce his wife for any reasons other than those stipulated in the  Hoodaya' canon, by the church, or to marry, violating the provisions given in the canon law. 4- Marriage is not merely an agreement, (5)It is a sacrament, and because it is by God that a woman in arranged for marriage to man, and they become one flesh, marriage shall not be conducted without a priest, who is the representative of God.<br><br><br>

                    1- Hebrew 13:4 Let marriage be held in honour by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.<br>

<BR><BR><BR><b>ABOUT ANOINTMENT OF THE SICK</b><br>
    1- It is necessary that one should pray for another. 2- Also to carry burdens mutually.  3- To pray especially for the sick; and for priests, through their counsels to make the sick, courageous in Spirit; to pray for their healing in body and Spirit and to anoint them with olive oil.<br>
    This oil, called "the Oil of grace, which is sanctified by bishops or by priests, who are permitted to bless olive oil, as per the Order of Kantheela (Order of anointing the sick) is applied on the sick, is effective in making the sick courageous enough to win over the temptation of Satan, and to show that they have renounced worldly ambitions, and their spirits have been anointed with the oil of the grace of the Lord. It can also be a means of healing, if the Lord wills.<br><br><br>

            1 – James 5:16 – And pray for one another. I Thes. 1:2. We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers, constantly.<br>

							        <b>ABOUT PRAYER</b><br>
		    Prayer is human beings' coming to realise their creator, and the good things that they receive from Him and praise Him, doing His will, raising their hearts to God the creator, to have communion with Him, in order to ask and secure from him those things which are needed for the Salvation of their souls and the wellbeing of the body. Those prayers which are approved and used in the Church, prepared by the holy fathers for use in prayers, for each day and the canonical hours, are usually called the common (public) prayer.<br>
            Whereas each person expressing gratefulness for the good that they receive from God, and entreating for their personal needs is called private prayer.<br>
            (1) Both these ways of prayer shall be done with devotion and faith.<br>
            (2) It is most appropriate to do the common public prayer in churches; and if it is not possible, to do the common public prayer in churches; and if it is not possible, to do them in houses, with all the people who can assemble there.<br>
            (3) According to the command of our Lord, and as ordained in the canon law and the order of services in the church, prayers shall be regularly said standing, and also prostrating; and kneeling on occasions like confession, ordination, Pentecost Sunday Service. Since it is not lawful to kneel and worship on Sundays and other festival days of the Lord; and also during the days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday, it shall be done accordingly.<br><br><br>

            <i>(1) James 1:6-8 But ask in faith, never doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind, for the doubter being double-minded and unstable in every way, must not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Matthew 21:22 Whatever you ask for in prayer in faith, you will receive.<br>

		            <b>ABOUT FASTING</b><br>
    (1)Fasting is the first command given by God to Adam, (2) which was observed in the Jewish church, as per the command of God, (3) what our Lord commanded, observed and taught (4) what his disciples used to observe, and what is ordained and confirmed and has been vogue in the church. (5) However, it is not enough to fast in the body alone, renouncing food, but fasting shall be in the spirit as well, by keeping away from evil. (6) The aim of fasting is to teach that spiritual things are more valuable than bodily things, to enrich the spirit by over powering bodily desires; to deny bodily desires and awaken the spirit to godly things, and that it shall be a weapon to defeat Satan.<br>
            Since love of appetite in the mother of numerous sins, fasting is an effective means to curb the sins that originate from it. (7) Therefore, Wednesday and Friday are to be observed as fasting days every week; besides , the fifty days' Lent, including the Passion Week, twenty five days' Lent, fifteen days' Lent, Apostles' Lent, three days' (Ninevah) Lent are the five fasting seasons ordained in the Church. During these days, (8) conjugal relationships, eating of fish and meat, and the like are to be renounced; and practices like eating one meal a day, fasting till noon shall be observed according to the ability of each person and the ordinances of the Church.<br><br><br>

            <i>(1) Genesis 2:17 – But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.<br>
            (2) Joel 2:12 – Yet even now, says the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; rend your hearts and not your clothing, Zach. 7:5-8<br>
            (3) St. Matthew 4:2 – He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished. St. Matthews 9:15 – The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.<br>
            (4) Acts 13:2 – While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".<br>
            (5) St. Matthew 6:16 – "And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting."<br>
            (6) Philemon 3:19 –Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. St. Matthew 17:21 But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.<br>
            (7) St. Luke 18:12 – I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.<br>
            (8) 1 Cor.7:5 – Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. II Samuel 1:12 & Daniel 1:8.</i>";

		    <b>ABOUT THE MEMORIAL DAYS OF SAINTS</b><br>
            (1)It is our duty and the right things to do, to observe the memorial days of the Mother of God, Apostles, Martyrs, and saintly men and women. (2) Their memory shall be a blessing, and their prayers a great help for us. Except for those days fixed to be observed as "Maranaya" festivals, on these memorial days, though it is not mandatory to keep away from worldly pursuits, (3) we shall try to meditate on the firm and deep faith of the saints, and follow their footsteps.<br><br><br>

		    <br><br><br><b>ABOUT THE MOTHER OF GOD</b><br>
            (1) Because, with the annunciation by the angel, God the Word, was conceived in the womb of the Virgin, and Godhead and manhood were united inseparably in the womb itself, and the virgin gave birth to Emmanuel, (2) Perfect God and perfect Man (3) the virgin shall be called "Mother of God". Because the Holy Virgin became eligible that her womb became the throne of the Son of God, (4) She remains virgin for ever, without knowing a man. (5) We have to call her ‘blessed' following the words of the angel, and desire especially for her prayers.<br><br><br>

            <i>(1) Luke 1.35 The angel said to her, " The Holy spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy ; he will be called Son of God"<br>
            (2) Isa 7.14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look the young women is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel<br>
            (3) Luke 1:43, And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me?<br>
            (4) John 19: 26-27 "Woman, here is your son, " Then  he said to the disciple, "Here is your mother."  And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own home. Ezekiel44:1-3.<br>
            (5) Luke 1:28,48 And he came to her and said, "Greetings, favoured one! The Lord is with you." For he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed.</i>";

		<b><br><br><br>ABOUT PRAYERS TO THE SAINTS</b><br>
            (1) Since the departed saints are living in spirit, (2) it is must that we respect and love them as we do the living saints for the sake of Christ. Because they are the beloved of Christ, when we respect and love them, we are actually respecting and loving our Lord. (3) The children of early fathers like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who were the beloved of God, remembered theirs, and prayed to God " Lord, have mercy on us for their sake." God listened to their prayers and granted their petition. In the same manner, it is good and acceptable before God, that we remember the saints who begot us in spirit, showed us the path of life, and shed their blood for the sake of Christ; and pray to God, "have mercy on us for their sake."<br>
            (4) Because death is only the separation of body and spirit and not something that annihilates the spirit; and (5) Since the spirits of saints, with the grace of the Holy Spirit; which God has endowed them with, sit in the (6) place of happiness and (7) praise the Lord like angels, and wish and pray for the salvation of the people of their world. It is beneficial for us to pray to such saints saying " You pray to the Lord for our sakes" (8) Since God not only listens to the prayer of saints, but also scans the ‘faith and intention of those who seek their help, in whatever way we consider, prayer to the saints is very good and highly rewarding.<br>
            (9) Whatever we do to the saints, as the loved ones of God, without equating them with God, are good and pleasing before Him. (10) Angels and the Spirits of saints know what is happening in the world, through the spiritual power that God has given them, and not through omniscience by nature. (11) While the power that Satan had before his fall has not been taken away from him after the fall, it shall be an insult to God and his servants, to say that the holy angels and the spirits of the saints who have attained perfection, are not given to know even things about themselves.<br>
            The departed saints, and the living ones praying for others, and being requested to pray for others, are only through the sole mediation of Christ; and never against it or in negation of it. Also prayer for each other in ordained by God. Therefore, prayer to the saints, does not decrease the power of the sole mediation of Christ or belittle it.<br>
            If the request to the departed saints, "pray for us" amounts to insulting the mediation of Christ, then the request to the living saints, "pray for us" also amounts to insulting the same mediation.<br>
            Thus it is difficult to understand the reasoning of those who say that the intersession of the living does not insult the mediation of Christ, but the intercession of the departed ones does. However, since prayer for each other and to the departed saints has been in vogue from very early times, and is befitting to the truth of the Bible, and it is being observed in the Holy Church to this day, and are seen to be highly beneficial, it is right and in order to observe it with devotion.<br><br><br>

				    "<b>ABOUT PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTED</b><br>

            It was for the sake of human beings, from Adam onwards to the last, that our Lord was born as a human being, observed fasting, offered himself as sacrifice, descended into hades and preached there, rose from dead, ascended to heaven, sat on the right hand side of His Father, and intercedes on our behalf. He did and continuous to do it that there shall be (2) graceful and just means to save them in the fullness of His love for His creations human beings, (3) also to give to all human beings a faultless and perfect example. Therefore, as becomes perfect love, we too, following the example given to us by our saviour and teacher, should wish and pray for the salvation of all the people from Adam.<br>
            (4) Just as Christ, who is the head,reckons all humans from Adam to the last as His own body and cares for them, it is becoming that all from Adam to the last, who are body parts of each other shall, as parts of each other, bear burdens mutually, and pray for each other. We pray of ourselves and our brethren who are living, saying, "Lord, forgive our sins", not because there is the possibility that we shall continue to live in our body and grow in righteousness, and God shall forgive our sins. Besides when we pray for those who are on their death bed, for their remission of sins, we do not pray that they be made to continue to live in their body and do righteous deeds, and then forgive their sins. We only pray that, whether they live or die, God may forgive their sins in His mercy. God has decreed the time upto last judgment as the period of mercy, not only for the living and those who are on the death bed, but also for (5) those who died with hope in God.<br>
            Prayer and sacrifice for the dead was a practice in the Jewish Church, (6) what our Lord practiced and taught his disciples, (7) what the Apostles too practiced, and what is practiced in the Church from very early times to this day. The hope of the departed regarding their salvation is augmented through our prayers; their sins are forgiven and they get consolation. Therefore, prayer for the dead is befitting, necessary and beneficial. However, if a worldly minded person takes life for granted thinking that others will pray for him when he is alive, and even after his death, it amounts to one of the deadly sins.<br>
            (8) And, even if all the saints, prophets and all the people of the world pray for him, he will not become eligible for grace. (9) Since he follows the negative reasoning that says, let us continue in sin, so that grace shall increase," he shall be devoid of grace. Those who receive grace while alive and even after death by prayers of others, are those who become eligible for grace with their firm faith in God, even though they have committed sins, but not deadly sins.";<br><br>

"Therefore just as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man"s act of righteousness leads to justification and life of all." 1 peter 3:19, John 17:20, Luke 7: 14,15 (8) And, even if all the saints, prophets and all the people of the world pray for him, he will not become eligible for grace. (9) Since he follows the negative reasoning that says, let us continue in sin, so that grace shall increase," he shall be devoid of grace. Those who receive grace while alive and even after death by prayers of others, are those who become eligible for grace with their firm faith in God, even though they have committed sins, but not deadly sins.<br>
            (2) 1 Peter 2:24 "He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness, by His wounds you have been healed". "(8) And, even if all the saints, prophets and all the people of the world pray for him, he will not become eligible for grace. (9) Since he follows the negative reasoning that says, let us continue in sin, so that grace shall increase," he shall be devoid of grace. Those who receive grace while alive and even after death by prayers of others, are those who become eligible for grace with their firm faith in God, even though they have committed sins, but not deadly sins.;<br>

				    <b>ABOUT BURIAL OF THE DEAD</b><br>
            For whatever man does by way of good or evil, while he lives in his body, he shall receive rewards or punishment in his body, (1) with a changed nature, after resurrection. Therefore it is unbecoming to bury the bodies of the deceased without prayers and other services, as if they are of animals. Instead, (2) since we have hope of resurrection, (3) the bishops, priests, the religious, lay people, etc. shall be buried, according to their stature, with prayers and services as ordained in the church. Great interest and devotion shall be shown in burying the dead. In the same way, if the children of Christian parents die without being baptised, they shall be buried with prayers, since they are the children of the faithful.<br><br><br>
            <i>1 – 1 Corinthians 15:53 For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality. II Cor. 5:10 – For all of us must appear before the judgement seat of Christ, so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil.<br>
            2 – Thes. 4:13 – But we do not want you to be uniformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others >>>do who have no hope.<br>
            3 – Eccl. 6:3 – A man may beget a hundred children, and live many years; but however many are the days of his years, if he does not enjoy life's good things, or has no burial, I say that a still born child is better off than.

		    <b>ABOUT FASTING, HOLY QURBANA,GIVING ALMS, ETC. FOR THE SAKE OF THE DEPARTED</b><br>

            Besides conducting prayers for parents and brethren who have slept in the Lord, (1) fasting for their sake, (2) offering Holy Qurbana on their memorial day, which recalls the sacrifice of our Lord, and entreats His mercy, giving alms which brings us mercy and grace from God, are good and pleasing before God. Whatever our Lord did, and also his sacrifice, are not only for the living, but also for the departed. According to the example he has showed us, we shall do everything we can, by word and deed, not only for those who are living but also for our departed; offering Holy Qurbana daily, and spending all wealth for feeding the poor, shall bring absolutely no benefit, to those who die with no faith in Christ, and are not eligible for the grace of God. However, those who do these good works with good intention, shall rap benefit out of them.<br><br>

The Cross that we should adore is not that which is made in the shape of a cross, using gold, silver, stone or wood. They are made as a memorial for our knowledge. One of the main reasons why a cross is not consecrated is this.<br>
            But nevertheless, the great God who cannot be seen or turned into a shape, shall be shaped in our hearts, and we look at it with our spiritual eyes and adore it. Likewise, we are to shape the cross of the son of God in our hearts, look at it with our spiritual eyes and adore it. (2) When we adore before the cross, it amounts to adoring the Lord who was crucified, and his death on the cross. Just what David did in front of the Ark of the Covenant, was reckoned as an act done before God, not as idolatry; adoring Christ and his death on the Cross shall be reckoned a blessing and not as idolatry. It is only decreed that (3) no images shall be made and worshipped.<br>
            (4) However, it is not considered as idolatry to make cross and other things for remembrance of Biblical events, (5) for information and for the decoration of the church, and using the church and church articles with respect and devotion.<br><br>

						    <b>ABOUT MARRIAGE OF THE CLERGY</b><br>
            Marriage is not unclean. But Church hierarchs like Patriarch, Catholicos, Metropolitan etc.; because they are specially responsible officials in the church, who should be constantly concerned about the church, they should be chaste and clean; and they should have emptied themselves from desires of the flesh, and surrendered their body and soul for God's work.<br>
            Because priests who administer the parishes will have to move closely with women as they do with men, (1) and human nature is frail and could easily be tempted, (2) it is most reasonable that the Church has decided that they should be upright, married and never involved in remarriage or marriage of widows.<br><br><br>

            (2) 1 Tim.3:2. Now a bishop must be above reproach, married only once, temperate, sensible, respectable, and hospitable, and an apt teacher.

            (1) God has decreed condemnation and salvation for man, for body and spirit; not for body alone, or for spirit alone. (2) Spirit is created by God, just as the body is. Though the spirit is created intelligent and eternal, it is not without impediments.

    <b>ABOUT SIN</b><br>

            (1) It is not only that all human beings are liable to be condemned because of original sin, but also all are condemned because of the sins of their actions. Though it is true that no in human being is without sin, (2) sin is not something created I man by nature. (3) It is related to the law of God, and sin was made when then the law of God was violated. (4) Man does good or evil, because of his freedom and not because of the variations of nature in creation. God never created anyone as a sinner. (5) He never compels anyone to do good or evil, to reward him accordingly. (6) But God makes it known to man what is good or evil; and it is God's desire that man shall turn to good and do good, and He helps man for that. He does not help man to do evil, since He does not like it,<br>
            (7) and He leaves everything to the will of man. (8) Satan is not given the power to compel anyone to do evil. (9) Satan makes man fall into sin only through temptation. Just as faith and good works vary, sins too vary. (10) However, there is no sin which will not be forgiven through repentance. Those sins, which are said to be for death, and against the Holy Spirit, are those which are not repented; which easily push man to helplessness. Such sins are not forgiven by the prayer of others alone. Therefore, we should not be frustrated about any sin, but should repent before the (11) merciful Lord with broken heart and tears.<br><br>

            <i>(1) Rom. 5:18 Therefore just as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man's act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all. Rom. 3:9-12 What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all, for we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin, as it is written:  "There is no one who is righteous, not even one, there is no one who has understanding, there is no one who seeks God. All have turned aside, together they have become worthless; there is no one who shows kindness, there is not even one." Gala. 3:22 But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Psal. 14:13. 1 John 1:8, 1 Kings 8:46, Eccl. 7:21.<br>
            (2) Eccl. 7:29 See, this alone I found, that God made human beings straightforward, but they have devised many schemes.Gen.1:26-27, 31.<br>
            (3) 1 Cor. 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law Rom. 4:15 For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation. Rom. 5:13 sin was indeed in the world before the law, but sin is not reckoned when there is no law.<br>
            (4) Deu. 11:26,27,28 See I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God  that I am commanding you today; and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn from the way that I am commanding you today, to follow other gods that you have not known. Deu. 30:15-20.<br>
            (5) James 1:13,14,15. No one when tempted, should say, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself Tempts no one. But one is tempted by one's own desire, being lured and enticed by it; then, when that desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and that sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death. 1 Peter 5:2 to tend the flock of God that is in your charge, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion but willingly, as God would have you do it not for sordid gain but eagerly. Isa. 1:19,20 2 Car. 9:7.<br>
            (6) Mic.6:8 He has told you. 0 mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? 1 Tim 2:4 who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Rom. 8:28. (7) Psal. 81:12. So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.<br>
            (8) James 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
            (9) Eph. 6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>
            (10) John 19:11 one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.<br>
            (11) Jeremiah 3:12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say_ Return, faithless Israel, says the Lord. I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, says the Lord; I will not be angry forever";</i>";

    <b>ABOUT JUSTIFICATION</b><br>
            (1)Just as faith without works in dead, (2) actions which do not arise from good conscience and faith are also dead. (3) The grace of God for mankind is not discriminatory; it is given to all uniformly. He never gives free grace to one and not to another. Therefore, man is not justified by faith alone without works, or by works alone without faith; nor free grace alone. (4) But justification is through free grace, by faith and works.<br><br>

            <i>(1) James 2.17, 26 So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead. For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.<br>
            (2) Rom. 14:23 for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. Matthew 6:3 But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.<br>
            (3) Rom. 3:22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. Rom. 10:11,12,13.<br>
            (4) James 2: 21, 22 Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was brought to completion by the works. Eph. 2:8. For by grace you have been saved through faith.</i>";


    <b>CONDEMNATION AND PUNISHMENT</b><br>

            (1) The faith and righteousness of all people are not of the same measure. In the same manner, the sins of all people are not of the same measure There are variations in faith, righteousness and sin, (2) Also, God does not give punishment or salvation on the day of judgement uniformly for all; but they vary according to the measure of faith and works of each one. (3) And that is eternal punishment or eternal salvation.<br>
            (4) If a person turns from good to evil, then his earlier good shall not be remembered. Similarly, if a person turns from evil to good, his earlier evil shall not be remembered. But each one shall receive eternal salvation or eternal condemnation, according to the standing that each one has in terms of good or evil.<br>
            (5) This merciful and just decision of God, instills in repentant person hope and interest. But the teaching of some people that salvation is predestined by God and is through free grace, it shall be the same for all, amounts to making the righteous God an unrighteous one.<br><br>

            <i>(1) Rom. 12:6 We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith. Matthew 8:10. When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith." Matthew 14:31, 5:22, 7:3, John 19:11.<br>
            (2) Matthew 7:2 For with the judgement you make you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get. Luke. 12:47. 48:1, I Con 15 41, 42, John 14:2.<br>
            (3) Matthew 25:46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. John 3:16, 36.<br>
            (4) Ezek. 18:21,22-24. But if the wicked turn away from all their sins that they have committed and keep all my statutes and do what is lawful and right, they shall surely live; they shall not die. None of the transgressions that they have committed shall be remembered against them; for the righteousness that they have done, they shall live. Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord God, and not rather that they should turn from their ways and live? But when the righteous turn away from their righteousness and commit iniquity and do the same abominable things that the wicked do, shall they live? None of the righteous deeds that they have done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which they are guilty and the sin they have committed, they shall die.<br>
            (5) Luke. 15:17,18,19 But when he came to himself he said ‘How many of my father's hired hands have bread enough and to spare.. but here I am dying of hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands"</i>";

            (1) When a person does not repent about the sins he has committed, and continues to do them, unwilling to move away for them, then it can he said his sin is unto death, and against the Holy Spirit.(2) However, any sinner, if he turns to God with sincere repentance, his sins shall be forgiven, whatever they he. True repentance is to grieve and ask pardon for sins (3) and stop committing sins; and resolve at heart to sincerely obey God in future as it pleases Him. The door of repentance shall not remain closed for any sinner. The teaching of the heretic "Navatheenar" that post- baptism sins, because they arc against the Holy Spirit, shall not be forgiven, is not to he believed; and no sinner shall listen to it and retract from repentance. Instead, they should repent with good hope and true faith about all the sins committed at any time or in any state and turn to God"<br>

            <i>(1)Luke 12: 10. And everyone who speaks a. word against the Son of Man be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 1 John 5:16.

Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but, I tell you. seventy-seven times." Matthew 26:74,75 Then he began to curse, and he swore an oath, "I do not know the man!" At that moment the cock crowed.

						<div class="panel-body">
		    <b>WHAT DO I DO IN CONFESSION?</b><br>
            The goal of Confession is not to meet a Priest, but rather to meet the true High Priest, our Lord Jesus Christ. So therefore, it is essential that we have alone time with God both before and after sitting with our father of confession.<br>
            How? Do the following:<br>
            <b>Step 1: Arrive early</b><br>
            Plan to arrive to church 15 minutes BEFORE you plan to meet your Priest. That will give you adequate time to prepare.<br>
            <b>Step 2: Spend 10 minutes alone with God before going to Priest</b><br>
            You should never spend more time talking with the Priest than you do with God – the goal is to meet Him right? Use this time to confirm your repentance and preparing to meet the Lord in Confession. In addition, this gives you a chance to review your list of sins for Confession. Some good prayers to pray during this time: Psalm 51 [50], Psalm 32, Psalm 130.<br>
            <b>Step 3: Confess your sins to Priest</b><br>
            This step shouldn't take more than 5 minutes [7 minutes at most]. If it takes more time than that, then you need to schedule an appointment for counseling. Confession shouldn't be telling stories. The story isn't important – the sin is. Focus less on the details of the story and more on the sin at the root. Your Priest will tell you when he needs the details.<br>
            <b>Step 4: Listen and Record</b><br>
            After telling all your sins, your Priest will advise you in some way. You should bring a notepad in order to write down what he says. Remember, it is not him speaking; he is just the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit. If God Himself is speaking, wouldn't you want to write it down?<br>
            <b>Step 5: Stand up and receive absolution</b><br>
            The priest will then instruct you to stand up and bow your head. He will then place his hands on your head and pray the absolution over you. In the same way that the priest's hands are used to perform the Mystery of the Eucharist, his hands are also used to administer the Mystery of Confession as well. It is not his hands, but rather God working through his hands to absolve your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. You should approach this moment as you would the table of communion – with awe and reverence for being able to partake of this great mystery of forgiveness.<br>
            <b>Step 6: Thanksgiving to God</b><br>
            After receiving this great mystery, you need to go spend at least a few minutes alone with God once again, thanking Him for His indescribable gift. Be fully assured that your sins are forgiven and that you have been released from the bondage of sin. You have conquered sin by bringing it to the feet of the Crucified One. Some recommended prayers:<br>
            Thanksgiving prayer, Psalm 85, Psalm 126, Psalm 103.";

    <b>ABOUT FREEDON OF CREATIONS,FOREKNOWLEDGE, PREDESTINATION</b><br>

                    Though man by nature is liable to lean towards good or evil, (1) human nature is created with the power of free will that he can behave as he chooses. Just as a person has the freedom to commit sin, he has the freedom not to commit sin, if he wills. God only wants that man shall turn his free will towards good, but he never compels anyone to do good or evil, and rewards condemnation or salvation accordingly. However, he helps those who ask him, to do good. Because, eventhough it is true that God has given man sharp intelligence and freedom to turn to what is good and abhor evil, (2) man does not have the power to do any good by himself without the power of God. (3) Because God hates evil, he does not help man to do evil, but leaves him to his own will.<br>
                    (4) God has the foreknowledge even before the creation of the universe, that such and such people shall be eligible for eternal life, trusting in grace through His Son; and that such and such people shall be eligible for eternal condemnation. (5) But God has not ordained earlier that such and such people shall inherit eternal life, and such and such shall inherit eternal hell. (6) it is not that God has no power and authority to appoint and sanctify for his service those about whom he has foreknowledge. (7) Nor is it that He has not set apart and sanctified those whom he has known in his foreknowledge, that they shall be eligible for his grace and his call.<br>
                    (8) It only means that God is unbiased, and full of justice and mercy. He does not create and predestine some people so that they become evil, and then punish them; nor does he create and predestine some people so that they become righteous, and the save them; it also means that he does not make some people inherit eternal life and some others eternal hell after making them do good or evil as predestined by him while denying them freedom of will.<br>
                    But the teaching of some people that whatever things men do, they are made to do so by God as predestined by Him, and these actions shall never be the cause for salvation or condemnation; that salvation and condemnation are given as predestined; shall generate in men the evil thought that "everything will happen as predetermined by God, irrespective of whatever I will or not." This will drag men to great dangers like disappointment, disinterest in spiritual matters ad unholy activities, and it makes a righteous God unrighteous.<br><br><BR>

                    <b>ABOUT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</b><br>
                    All are bound to accept as prominent those books in the Old and New Testament, written through the Holy Spirit, set apart and confirmed by the holy Fathers canonically.<br><br>
                    Names and number of the important books in the Old Testament<br>
                    Books of Moses &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br>
                    Book of Joshua,son of Nun &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
                    Book of Judges &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
                    Book of Ruth&nbsp &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>
                    Esther(it is included in the Bible we use today)<br>
                    Book of Samuel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br>
                    Book of Kings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br>
                    Book of Chronicles &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br>
                    Book of Ezra(including Nehemiah)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br>
                    Book of Maccabees &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>
                    Book of Job &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
                    Book of David containing 150 Psalms &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
                    Book of Solomon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br>
                    Book of Prophets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16<br>
                    Old Testament— Total(including<BR>
                    the 39 books of Protestant Churches)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41<br><br>
                    In the above list, there is mention about four books of Solomon because his Book of Proverbs is divided into two. Proverbs chapter 25, verse 1, gives a title, "Solomon's Deep Proverbs." Hence the next portion of the book is considered as a separate book. In the 16 prophetical books, book of Daniel is included with Soosan.<br><BR>

                    The important books in the New Testment and their number are as follows:<br>
                    Evangelion(gospels)books&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br>
                    Epistles of Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br>
                    Epistles of Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br>
                    Epistles of John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br>
                    Epistle of James&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br>
                    Epistle of Judah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br>
                    Epistles of Clement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br>
                    Book of Acts of Apostles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br><br>
                    The following books are also approved in the church as important. However, Fathers like Athanasius the great, Dionysius of Alexandria have expressed doubts about some of them, and have recommended some others to be read for learning and edification. The following books belong to this category:<br>
                    The Big Book of Wisdom of Solomon, Book of Baraseera, Book of Esther, Book of Judith<br>
                    Book of Tobit, 'Didache' of Apostles, Books of Sherpherd Hermas, Book of Revelation of St. John<br>
                    Epistle of Barnabas and Revelation of Paul and others<br>
                    The Holy Bible: Our books (Orthodox) 41+28=69 and for Protestants 39 +27 = 66<br><br>
                    All the books written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit are useful for teaching, good counsel, exercise in righteousness, and confirmation in faith. Therefore just as liturgical books, devotional hymns, sermons, interpretations, historical books, Canon laws etc. prepared by the Doctors of the Holy Orthodox Church are approved in the Church, such writings prepared in the future shall be approved only after being examined by the chief hierarchs of the church.";
